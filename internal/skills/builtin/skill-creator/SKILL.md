# Skill Creator

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend the agent's capabilities by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools.

### What Skills Provide

1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

## Core Principles

### Concise is Key

The context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else the agent needs. Only add context the agent doesn't already have.

Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.

### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:

**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid.
**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists.
**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone.

### Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code
    ├── references/       - Documentation
    └── assets/           - Files used in output
```

## Skill Creation Process

1. Understand the skill with concrete examples
2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)
3. Initialize the skill directory
4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)
5. Package the skill

### Skill Naming

- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only
- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action
- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name

### SKILL.md Frontmatter

Write the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:

- `name`: The skill name
- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill

Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.
